Put the models folder in the project root directory

Only latest trained model is included to avoid the project file size going too big

Use Application.ipynb to use the pretrained model and read the previous training statistics

CIFAR10_ResNext_Deep_Learning.ipynb is the file for training CIFAR10 dataset

Pikachu_ResNext_Deep_Learning.ipynb is the file for training Pikachu dataset

models directory store all the pretrained model according to epoch, the .json file in the directory store the stats for previous training

runs directory is for TensorBoard used

pikachu dataset directory consists of pikachu binary classification image
